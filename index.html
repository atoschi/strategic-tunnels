title: Modular Decision-Making and Drivable Areas for Multi-Agent Autonomous Racing
subtitle: Abstract— This paper presents an interaction-aware, modular framework for local trajectory planning in autonomous
driving, particularly suited for multi-agent racing scenarios. Our framework first identifies viable drivable areas (tunnels),
taking into account predictions of other agents’ behaviors, and subsequently utilizes a high-level decision-making module
to select the optimal corridor considering both static and moving vehicles. This decision-making module also strategically
determines when to follow an opponent or initiate an overtaking maneuver, while ensuring compliance with racing regulations.
A Model Predictive Control (MPC) module is then employed to compute an optimal, collision-free trajectory within the chosen
corridor. The proposed modular architecture simplifies the computational complexity typically associated with MPC optimiza-
tion, and facilitates independent component testing. Simulations and real-world tests on various racing tracks demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach, even in highly dynamic interactive scenarios with multiple simultaneous opponents; videos of these
and additional experiments are available at this link.
